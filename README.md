This repo contains the terraform configuration for the solution to a class study task:
1. Create EC2 instances based on a list of instance types:

    - Use a for loop to iterate over the list and create an EC2 instance for each instance type.
    - Define a variable that contains a list of instance types.

2. Create DNS records for multiple domains:
      - Define a variable that contains a list of domain names.
      - Use a for loop to iterate over the list and create DNS records for each domain.

3. Manually create a resource of your choice and use terraform import to merge it into your statefile
     Criteria:
        - Proper merged to statefile
        - Delete the resource using terraform destroy command

The image below showcases the creation of 4 ec2 instances based on 4 different instance type, automated the process using for loop.
